# Decentralized Research Paper Vault (DRPV)

## Overview
The Decentralized Research Paper Vault is a platform designed to revolutionize the academic publishing and licensing ecosystem. It aims to address several key problems faced by researchers, authors, and readers in the current system:

1. **Intermediary Delays:** Traditional licensing platforms involve numerous intermediaries, leading to significant delays in checking and issuing licenses. Our decentralized platform streamlines this process, reducing time and increasing efficiency.

2. **Centralized Control:** Existing systems are often controlled by a few major publishers, leading to monopolistic practices and high costs for access. Decentralization ensures fairer and more competitive pricing.

3. **Transparency and Trust:** The use of blockchain technology ensures transparency in the licensing process, making it easier to verify the authenticity of licenses and preventing unauthorized secondary data usage.

4. **Incentives for Authors:** Our platform offers better incentives for authors by providing more direct and fair compensation mechanisms, thus encouraging more researchers to share their work.

5. **Access and Availability:** By removing barriers and reducing costs, our decentralized licensing platform improves access to research papers, making knowledge more widely available and accelerating scientific progress.

## How it Works
1. Authors upload their research papers to the platform.
2. Users can browse and purchase papers using cryptocurrency.
3. Authors receive fair compensation for their work.
4. Transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and security.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Create .env file then write NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID and pass the walletconnect cloud id
4. Start the application with `npm run dev`.

## Problem Solved
The Decentralized Research Paper Vault addresses the inefficiencies and inequalities in the current academic publishing and licensing system by providing a decentralized, transparent, and fair platform for sharing and accessing research papers.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity for smart contract development
- Ethereum blockchain for decentralized storage and execution
- Next.js for the frontend user interface
- IPFS for file storage and retrieval

## Future Development
In the future, we plan to implement additional features such as peer review mechanisms, collaboration tools, and integration with academic institutions to further enhance the platform's functionality and impact.
